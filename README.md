# Question 1
Have shared the test cases in an excel file.
There are 3 tabs for **Frontend**, **Backend** and **Automation** Test cases
Time spent was mainly on the **layout** of the requirement and what all possible scenarios would come when **user would interact** with the form data.
And then how effectively we can automate the test cases.

# Question 2
Programming done on **Python** and **Selenium Library** to Automate the steps
IDE used: **PyCharm**
**Test cases: 4**
Test Result are attached in the folder with image name: "**testCasesResult.PNG**"

Steps to execute the test cases
1) Python must be installed in the machine.(My development was done on windows)
2) Go to folder "Question 2" and from file explorer type "cmd" so that we can go to command prompt with this path
3) Selenium library needs to be installed if already not there in system.
  type pip install selenium (it would install the selenium library)
4) Executable python file is "AllTests.py". In Command Prompt type "AllTests.py -v".  It will execute the test cases one by one, and show the test message when it will execute.
5) Alternatively we can run the test cases from IDE. I have used PyCharm. Just load the "Question 2" folder and run the "AllTests.py" file. It will execute the test cases one by one.


# Question 3
Have shared the suggestions based on my opinoin on the excel sheet.
